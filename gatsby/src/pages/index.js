        <p>Hey ðŸ‘‹ we are Isaac & Vanessa</p>
        <p>
          We are moving back to Brisbane after a few years living in Tauranga.
          To prepare for the move, we are wanting to sell some of our stuff.
          Some of it is new, some of it pre-loved...all of it in good condition!
        </p>
        <p>
          Check out what we are selling and let us know if anything interests
          you!
        </p>
        <Link>Browse our stuff</Link>
      </HomePageContainer>
